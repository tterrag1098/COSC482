\mainpage Wavefront Simple OBJ File Loader

\tableofcontents

\section intro Introduction

This example shows how to load a simple Wavefront obj file.  In addition,
it uses several light sources and several textures, including a cube map
drawn on a sphere, of a starfield.  The GraphicsEngine.cpp file has several
commented lines of code that will allow the user to quickly make updates
to the scene and the properties of the materials, lights, and textures.

\section usage Usage

\subsection run Running the Program

- The program can be run through explorer by double-clicking the executable name.

\subsection options User Options

- Escape:  Ends the program.
- M: Toggles between fill mode and line mode to draw the triangles.
- R: Resets the window size to 700 X 500.
- A: Resets the window size to 600 X 600.
- X: Toggles the graphing of the axes.
- F9: Saves a screen shot of the graphics window to a png file.
- F10: Saves a screen shot of the graphics window to a jpeg file.
- F11: Turns on the spherical camera.
- F12: Turns on the yaw-pitch-roll camera.

- Alt+Left: Increases the light's theta value.
- Alt+Right: Decreases the light's theta value.
- Alt+Up: Increases the light's psi value.
- Alt+Down: Decreases the light's psi value.
- Alt+Ctrl+Up: Decreases the light's radius.
- Alt+Ctrl+Down: Increases the light's radius.

If the spherical camera is currently selected,

- Left: Increases the camera's theta value.
- Right: Decreases the camera's theta value.
- Up: Increases the camera's psi value.
- Down: Decreases the camera's psi value.
- Ctrl+Up: Decreases the camera's radius.
- Ctrl+Down: Increases the camera's radius.

If the yaw-pitch-roll camera is currently selected,

- Left: Increases the yaw.
- Right: Decreases the yaw.
- Up: Increases the pitch.
- Down: Decreases the pitch.

- Ctrl+Left: Increases the roll.
- Ctrl+Right: Decreases the roll.
- Ctrl+Up: Moves the camera forward.
- Ctrl+Down: Moves the camera backward.

- Shift+Left: Moves the camera left.
- Shift+Right: Moves the camera right.
- Shift+Up: Moves the camera up.
- Shift+Down: Moves the camera down.

If the spherical camera is currently selected, a click and drag with the left mouse
button will alter the theta and psi angles of the spherical camera to give the impression
of the mouse grabbing and moving the coordinate system.

\note Note that the shader programs "VertexShaderLightingTexture.glsl" and "PhongMultipleLightsAndTexture.glsl"
are expected to be in the same folder as the executable.  Your graphics card must also be
able to support OpenGL version 3.3 to run this program.
